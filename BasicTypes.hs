\section[BasicTypes]{Miscellanous types}

This module defines a miscellaneously collection of very simple
types that

\begin{itemize}
\item have no other obvious home
\item don't depend on any other complicated types
\item are used in more than one "part" of the compiler

Keeping Source Text for source to source conversions

Note [Pragma source text]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The lexer does a case-insensitive match for pragmas, as well as
accepting both UK and US spelling variants.

So

  {-# SPECIALISE #-}
  {-# SPECIALIZE #-}
  {-# Specialize #-}

will all generate ITspec_prag token for the start of the pragma.

In order to be able to do source to source conversions, the original
source text for the token needs to be preserved, hence the
`SourceText` field.

So the lexer will then generate

  ITspec_prag "{ -# SPECIALISE"
  ITspec_prag "{ -# SPECIALIZE"
  ITspec_prag "{ -# Specialize"

for the cases above.
 [without the space between '{' and '-', otherwise this comment won't parse]


Note [Literal source text]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The lexer/parser converts literals from their original source text
versions to an appropriate internal representation. This is a problem
for tools doing source to source conversions, so the original source
text is stored in literals where this can occur.

Motivating examples for HsLit

  HsChar          '\n'       == '\x20`
  HsCharPrim      '\x41`#    == `A`
  HsString        "\x20\x41" == " A"
  HsStringPrim    "\x20"#    == " "#
  HsInt           001        == 1
  HsIntPrim       002#       == 2#
  HsWordPrim      003##      == 3##
  HsInt64Prim     004##      == 4##
  HsWord64Prim    005##      == 5##
  HsInteger       006        == 6

For OverLitVal

  HsIntegral      003      == 0x003
  HsIsString      "\x41nd" == "And"

{-
Note [InlinePragma]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This data type mirrors what you can write in an INLINE or NOINLINE pragma in
the source program.

If you write nothing at all, you get defaultInlinePragma:
   inl_inline = False
   inl_act    = AlwaysActive
   inl_rule   = FunLike

It's not possible to get that combination by *writing* something, so
if an Id has defaultInlinePragma it means the user didn't specify anything.

If inl_inline = True, then the Id should have an InlineRule unfolding.

Note [CONLIKE pragma]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ConLike constructor of a RuleMatchInfo is aimed at the following.
Consider first
    {-# RULE "r/cons" forall a as. r (a:as) = f (a+1) #-}
    g b bs = let x = b:bs in ..x...x...(r x)...
Now, the rule applies to the (r x) term, because GHC "looks through"
the definition of 'x' to see that it is (b:bs).

Now consider
    {-# RULE "r/f" forall v. r (f v) = f (v+1) #-}
    g v = let x = f v in ..x...x...(r x)...
Normally the (r x) would *not* match the rule, because GHC would be
scared about duplicating the redex (f v), so it does not "look
through" the bindings.

However the CONLIKE modifier says to treat 'f' like a constructor in
this situation, and "look through" the unfolding for x.  So (r x)
fires, yielding (f (v+1)).

This is all controlled with a user-visible pragma:
     {-# NOINLINE CONLIKE [1] f #-}

The main effects of CONLIKE are:

    - The occurrence analyser (OccAnal) and simplifier (Simplify) treat
      CONLIKE thing like constructors, by ANF-ing them

    - New function coreUtils.exprIsExpandable is like exprIsCheap, but
      additionally spots applications of CONLIKE functions

    - A CoreUnfolding has a field that caches exprIsExpandable

    - The rule matcher consults this field.  See
      Note [Expanding variables] in Rules.hs.
